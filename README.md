## Our Product:

We want to create a web application which displays books for people in Founders & Coders to share.

## User Story:

**As a member of Founders & Coders who has a book I would like to share...**
* I can add a book to the database

**As a member of Founders & Coders who is interested in borrowing a book...**
* I can browse for available books
* I can reserve a book for certain dates
* I can unreserve a book

**Suggested additional requirements / stretch goals:**
* I can rate the book after I've read it
* Books can simultaneously be reserved by multiple users but for different dates
